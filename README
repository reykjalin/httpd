A socket is initialized at the specified port (see usage) and the server waits for requests.

When a request is received, it's processed and all information is extracted and stored.
If the request was empty, the server waits for up to 30 seconds before closing the connection.

After the request has been processed a response is generated depending on what kind of
request was received.

The server can not handle parallel connections.



Usage:
To build the program move to the main directory and run
make -C src

To run the server run
./httpd <port>
    port: Port number used for server connection



Implementation Details:
HEAD:
  A simple header with 200 OK response is sent back
GET:
  A page is generated containing the requested URL and headers, although headers are currently
  not working due to access issues in the data structure. Headers are accessible through the
  httpRequest struct, but not through the hash table provided in utility.h.
POST:
  A page is generated containing the posted data

If the test page is requested a page is generated containing the URI query in the URL.
If the colour page is requested WITH a query for bg an empty page is generated with the
background color set as the one in the query.

An error is sent (400 Bad Request) if the http client fails to provide a Host header.
No other error responses have been implemented.
